This repo is where I regularly publish and update my learnings and design implementations.

```
1. IP :-
   Internet Protocol is a unique identifier for a device over a network. It contains the address of the device which helps in communication over the internet or local network. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers and website. IP addresses provide a way to do so.

   Versions:-

   IPv4 :-
   The original IP which uses a 32-bit dot decimal notation.This allows only upto 4 Billion IP addresses. Ex:- 102.22.192.181

   IPv6:-
   As the Internet grew, we needed something better. IPv6 uses 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation. It can allow upto ~340e+36 address( 340 followed by 36 zeros!). This is more than enough to meet the growing demand of the internet in teh coming years.

   Types:-

   Public:-
   One IP Address is assigned to a whole netowrk. So, all the devices connected to the network have the same public IP. Example :- IP address of your router provided by the ISP.

   Private:-
   Private IP Address is a range of non-internet facing IP addresses used in an internal network. Private IP Addresses are provided by network devices like, routers. Example:- IP address generate by your home router for your devices.

   Static:-
   A static IP is an IP address that does not change over time. It is a better option for enterprises which own websites and internet services. These are expensive but more reliable.

   Dynamic:-
   A Dynamic IP is an IP address that changes from time to time. It is assigned by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. These are better suited for home networks and personal internet use.
